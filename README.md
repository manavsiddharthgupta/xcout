# 🗺️ **Xcout AI**

> **Now Google Places searches live in your chat!** Skip the endless scrolling through maps - just ask and discover places through natural conversation.

## ✨ **What is this?**

We transforms how you discover places by bringing **Google Places API directly into a conversational chat interface**. Instead of wrestling with map pins and complex filters, simply ask questions like a human would:

- _"Find me cozy coffee shops near Central Park"_
- _"What are the best sushi restaurants in Tokyo?"_
- _"Tell me about 123 Main Street, New York"_
- _"Show me budget-friendly hotels near the airport"_

Get **rich, actionable place information** with ratings, reviews, contact details, and direct Google Maps links - all through natural conversation.
